This project is a "Etch-a-Sketch", a computerized version of the popular drawing toy. This project was made to showcase my DOM manipulation skills. Javascript was used to create all the html for this project.

This project starts as a 16x16 grid that scales to 100x100 whilst keeping its dimensions.
